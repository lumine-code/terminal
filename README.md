# terminal

A terminal emulator built into Lumine.

Runs real system shells inside the workspace, rendered with [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) and driven by [node-pty](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty).

## Features

- **Real shells**: spawns system shells such as bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell, and cmd through node-pty.
- **xterm.js rendering**: draws output with xterm.js and an optional WebGL renderer that falls back to canvas.
- **Flexible placement**: opens terminals in the workspace center, any dock, or a split of the active pane.
- **Editor integration**: runs or inserts the editor's selected text in the active terminal.
- **Find**: searches the scrollback with an in-terminal find palette.
- **Theming**: derives its colors from the active syntax theme, or from explicit color settings.
- **Ligatures**: optionally renders coding-font ligatures such as `==` and `>=`.

## Usage

When a terminal is focused it handles most keystrokes itself, so some Lumine commands may not fire until you move focus out of it with `terminal:unfocus`.

## Commands

Commands available in `atom-workspace`:

- `terminal:focus`: focus the active terminal, or create one in the default location if none is open,
- `terminal:open`: open a new terminal in the default location,
- `terminal:open-center`: open a new terminal in the workspace center,
- `terminal:open-bottom-dock`: open a new terminal in the bottom dock,
- `terminal:open-left-dock`: open a new terminal in the left dock,
- `terminal:open-right-dock`: open a new terminal in the right dock,
- `terminal:open-split-up`: open a new terminal by splitting the active pane upward,
- `terminal:open-split-down`: open a new terminal by splitting the active pane downward,
- `terminal:open-split-left`: open a new terminal by splitting the active pane leftward,
- `terminal:open-split-right`: open a new terminal by splitting the active pane rightward,
- `terminal:focus-next`: focus the next terminal,
- `terminal:focus-previous`: focus the previous terminal,
- `terminal:run-selected-text`: run the editor's selected text in the active terminal,
- `terminal:insert-selected-text`: insert the editor's selected text into the active terminal,
- `terminal:close`: close the active terminal,
- `terminal:close-all`: close every open terminal.

Commands available in `terminal-view`:

- `terminal:find`: open the find palette,
- `terminal:find-next`: jump to the next find match,
- `terminal:find-previous`: jump to the previous find match,
- `terminal:set-selection-as-find-pattern`: use the selected terminal text as the find pattern,
- `terminal:clear`: clear the terminal screen,
- `terminal:send-sigint`: send an interrupt (SIGINT) to the running process,
- `terminal:restart`: restart the terminal's process,
- `terminal:unfocus`: move focus from the terminal to its pane container.

## Customization

The terminal treats CSS custom properties on `:root` as the source of truth for its colors. Redefine any of them in your `styles.less` to override the defaults:

```css
:root {
  --terminal-color-red: #ff5555;
  --terminal-color-green: #50fa7b;
  --terminal-cursor-color: #f8f8f2;
}
```

## Services

- **terminal** (`2.0.0`): provided to let other packages open terminals and run commands in them.
- **platformioIDETerminal** (`1.1.0`): provided to offer the widely used `platformio-ide-terminal` service API for backward compatibility.
